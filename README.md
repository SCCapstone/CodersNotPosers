# Campus Eats

Campus Eats is an IOS app which is designed to allow student and falculty to place orders for food from campus dining 
locations no matter where they are on campus. It gives students options for jobs, as the food ordered by students or 
faculty will be delivered by students or faculty, and potentially allows more people to order food than normal since it
is more convenient for kids who have class to place an order instead of having to go out of their way to find a dining 
location.

## External Requirements

In order to build this project you first have to install:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

If you have a mac:
* [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

If you have a windows, use a VM

## Setup

Here you list all the one-time things the developer needs to do after cloning
your repo. Sometimes there is no need for this section, but some apps require
some first-time configuration from the developer, for example: setting up a
database for running your webapp locally.

-- Need to fill out --

## Running

Specify the commands for a developer to run the app from the cloned repo.

# Deployment

Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the 
Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
. Note that you **do not put passwords in git**. 

Mobile apps will also sometimes need some instructions on how to build a
"release" version, maybe how to sign it, and how to run that binary in an
emulator or in a physical phone.

# Testing - 492

In 492 you will write automated tests. When you do you will need to add a 
section that explains how to run them.

The unit tests are in `/test/unit`.

The behavioral tests are in `/test/casper/`.

## Testing Technology - 492

In some cases you need to install test runners, etc. Explain how.

## Running Tests - 492

Explain how to run the automated tests.
